# MEND_URL: the mend url that you login to - (https://saas.mend.io) for example
# MEND_EMAIL: the user email for the mend platform account that you wish to scan with. This should be stored as a secret and then translated to MEND_EMAIL at runtime.
# MEND_USER_KEY: the user key found under my profile for the user you wish to scan with. This should be stored as a secret and then translated to MEND_USER_KEY at runtime.
# 
# REPO_NAME: The repository where the image should be stored/pulled from
